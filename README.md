# Attendance App

This project is a web application for managing attendance, primarily using Flask for the backend and HTML(Not rerally a frontend guy :) ) for the frontend. It incorporates face recognition for user authentication and attendance logging.

## How to Run Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Goderr/Attendance-App.git
    cd Attendance-App
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend (Python/Flask):**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
    Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3.  **Access the frontend:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the Flask application is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
